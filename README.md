Microagressions App

Microaggressions are everyday comments and actions that oppressed communities face. This is a first version of a CRUD app that allows users to read, add and remove microagressions towards queer community.

Disclaimer: This project is heavily inspired by the [Micropedia](https://www.themicropedia.org/), the first encyclopedia of microagressions.
