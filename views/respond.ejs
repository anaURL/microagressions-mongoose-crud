            <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8"> 🎧 Take an interest in other people; ask open questions about their lives and interests. Genuinely care about their answers. </p>

            <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8">  ♠️ Look to understand a person at the surface level as well as their deeper world view. </p>
                
                <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8">  👀 Observe and acknowledge their facial reactions and body language. Be on the lookout for mismatches between what people say and how they act.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8"> 🌽 Try to listen without prejudice. It is too easy to cancel others because their views don’t chime with your own. Instead get curious, listen intently. Learn.</p>
                
                        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8">  🥵 If people get angry, get EVEN more curious! This is usually a precursor to fascinating insight. Stay calm.</p>
                
                            <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8">  🆘 Acknowledge rapport is impossible with some people. Don’t be afraid to pull the ejector handle (like Goose from Top Gun – hopefully with better results).</p>
                
                                <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8">  🪂 Exit with dignity. “I know lots of other people will want to chat with you, so I must not monopolise your time”.</p>
                
                                    <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl m-4 mt-8">    🥂Treat people well. Respect people’s dignity. These tips work as well for insight research as for evening drinks, networking or even at a wedding.</p>
