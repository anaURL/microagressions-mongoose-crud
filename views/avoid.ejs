            <p class= "text-2xl m-4"> First, recognize that it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. Many people with good intentions inadvertently say hurtful or offensive things from time to time. When you meet someone new, your brain instinctively begins to categorize the person and notice differences. It‚Äôs when our brains get ‚Äústuck‚Äù in these differences that microaggressions happen.  </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl m-4 mt-8 font-black">  ‚èØ PAUSE</h2>
            <p class= "text-2xl m-4">  Don‚Äôt be in a rush to speak or act. Pause before asking someone a personal question. 
                Pause before you describe a person‚Äôs personality in a certain way. Pause before you make a comparison between someone 
                and something else you‚Äôve seen. These simple thoughts and moments are where bias lives so taking a second to think about
                 it make all the difference. </p>

                 <h2 class="text-3xl m-4 mt-8 font-black">  ü§® QUESTION </h2>
                 <p class= "text-2xl m-4"> Ask yourself these important questions. Is your brain getting stuck on differences that 
                    you‚Äôre noticing? Are they triggering things that you subconsciously believe? Are you making assumptions because of 
                    these beliefs? What will the person I‚Äôm interacting with feel or think when I say or do this? Awareness of our own bias
                     comes when we answer these questions for ourselves. </p>

                     <h2 class="text-3xl m-4 mt-8 font-black">  üñº REFRAME </h2>
                 <p class= "text-2xl m-4">See the bigger picture. Sit in the uncomfortableness of your questions. List the things you can 
                    do to change your thoughts and behaviors. This could include researching other cultures and the history of certain phrases
                     to acknowledging the systems that give you the privilege of removing offensive phrases from your vocabulary one by one. 
                     Stop your defensive thoughts. Acknowledge that you can cause microaggressions, but it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. 
                     Unlearning bias won‚Äôt happen overnight.</p>
