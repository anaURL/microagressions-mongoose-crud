        <p class=" font-semibold text-4xl m-8 text-black"> The goal of the platform is to educate about microagressions towards people based on their gender identity and/or sexual orientation, 
          as they can take many forms and can often be very subtle, which makes them hard to recognize. </p>  
          
          <!-- <p class=" font-semibold text-4xl m-8 text-black"> Microaggressions are the everyday slights, insults, put-downs, and invalidations that marginalized communities 
          experience in their day-to-day interactions with individuals who are unaware that they are engaging in an offensive or demeaning form of behavior 
          (Dr. Wing Sue, Health Matters, 2019). </p>

    Nasty, shady, disrespectful, weak.. How would you describe microagressions?</h2>
    <p class= "mx-auto max-w-7xl mb-8 text-3xl text-gray-900 m-6 ">  These (subtle) comments usually come from the societal belief that straight or cis, for example, is a sign of being “normal”. 
  Assuming someone's gender pronouns, not asking about their pronouns or/and continuing to use the wrong pronouns after the correct ones have been shared is one very 
  common example of microaggression that deny the personal experience, emotions, or thoughts of a person. Comments like "You're too sensitive, I'm not transphobic!" 
  and asking a same-sex couple, “Is one of you the husband and the other the wife?” can make people feel or believe that they are devalued, and have serious effects 
  on one's self-esteem, mental health and their well-being in general. </p>
